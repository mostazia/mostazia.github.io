              I will always remember December 31, 2021 as the most anticlimactic
              New Year's Eve of my life. For most young Americans, New Year's
              Eve is a day to dress up, meet up with relatives or friends, and
              anticipate the coming year. For seventeen-year-old Stacy Vazquez,
              New Year's Eve was the day to write nine college essays. I don't
              remember the countdown, but I do remember watching the date and
              timestamp at the bottom right corner of my laptop screen switch to
              1/1/2022 and 12:00 AM. For the first time in hours, I rose from my
              kitchen table and hugged my mother and sister. Then, I took a few
              pictures and returned to my seat to continue typing my life story
              away. I had less than nine hours to submit three college
              applications.
              <br /><br />
              This behavior is somewhat expected of a major procrastinator who
              doesn't really care about the outcome of the college decisions but
              wants to apply anyway. This behavior, though, is not expected of a
              young girl who has been dreaming of getting into her dream school
              since ninth grade.
              <br /><br />
              For how much I cared, I should've had my college essays and Common
              App complete and revised by October. But, my power combination of
              writer's block and procrastination had me submitting my
              applications at 11:59:59. The college application speedwriting
              continued for five more days.
              <br /><br />
              Today marks a year since my college decisions were finalized. By
              April 1, 2022, I had collected all of my acceptances, waitlists,
              and rejections. And, my four-year-long journey to college came to
              an end.
              <br /><br />
              Since then, my college essays have been sitting in a folder that I
              haven't clicked on in months. So, I feel it is time that I share
              some of my essays with the world and potentially help younger
              students who are in need of inspiration or guidance. And, maybe I
              can even save some Duolingo streaks! (Yes, I lost my 616 day
              Duolingo streak on January 1, 2022 because of college apps, and I
              still haven't recovered.)
              <br /><br />
              So, if you're a high school student reading this a few months
              before your applications are due, open that common app, add some
              schools, and start reading those prompts! And, if you're a senior
              reading this with less than twenty-four hours to submit your
              college apps, don't lose hope! I believe in you!
              <br /><br />
              So, without further ado, here are some of the essays that got me
              to Cambridge:

              <span id="stanford" class="blogPostContentH2"
                >Stanford Supplement: El Semanario</span
              >
              <br />
              <i>Tell us about something that is meaningful to you and why.</i>
              <br /><br />
              I was fifteen when my mom gifted me a “semanario”, a collection of
              seven bracelets, symbolizing each day of the week. I fidgeted with
              them, as she explained their origin. She bought them when she was
              about fifteen. She saved up for them.
              <br /><br />
              They weren't very expensive, for they aren't real silver. But,
              given her financial conditions, they were a reach.
              <br /><br />
              Since I put the bracelets on, they've become my most precious
              jewelry. They're not silver, and they're stained. But, they
              represent the work of my fifteen-year-old mother, a girl who had
              to drop out of school to help sustain her family. I now wear one
              of the only treats she gave herself. And, the longer I've worn
              them, the more meaning they've taken.
              <br /><br />
              There are seven bracelets. Since she started retirement, my mom
              hasn't failed to be there for me seven days a week, from the
              moment I wake up to when I fall asleep. They are perfect circles,
              reminding me of her endless love, a love without boundaries, a
              smooth continuous love.
              <br /><br />
              Every formal event, I wear the bracelets. They're not the shiniest
              or cleanest, but they are symbols of the beginning of her journey
              to give her children a better life.
              <br /><br />
              This Semanario has become my treasure. They're a gift from a
              fifteen-year-old girl who had endless dreams she couldn't fulfill
              to a fifteen-year-old girl who has endless dreams she will fight
              to fulfill. My mother gifted me her bracelets. I will gift her my
              future.

                are required of you. Tell us about something you do simply for

              I carefully roll a scoop of strawberry ice cream; I estimate the
              center and drop it on a trio of perfectly baked chocolate chip
              cookies. I add a cherry and serve it to the customer. He cheers
              and gives me a $30.50 tip.
              <br /><br />
              Unfortunately, this delicious treat only exists within the realm
              of my phone. I am a fanatic of Papa's Scooperia. I enjoy
              calculating the speed to scoop the dough to the ideal size. I
              enjoy the thrill of serving an order while another is baking in
              the oven. I enjoy the short, yet fun Foodini minigames. I enjoy
              redecorating my lobby and character's outfit to match the holiday.
              Why do I enjoy this? I'm not quite sure.
              <br /><br />
              At the beginning of the year, we read the short story “Eleven” in
              English. The narrator explains that each year we grow older is
              another year we can “be”. Like rings of a tree trunk, our ages
              stay within and sometimes show.
              <br /><br />
              My hobby of playing Papa Louie games started in elementary school.
              Whenever we could use Chromebooks, I rushed to CoolMathGames to
              play. Lately, it feels like I am growing rather quickly. Though I
              am excited for every new thing coming into my life, I also miss my
              early childhood. Perhaps the girl who loves to play Scooperia is
              my seven-year-old self, returning for another round of Cool Math.
              <br /><br />
              Sometimes, I am seventeen and want to explore the universe.
              Sometimes, I am seven and want to serve a sundae.

                Gates Scholarship Essay: Art and STEM as part of my identity

              The skirts flow. Our feet tap on the wooden gym floor as the
              violins of the Jarabe Tapatío echo throughout the room. Heel, Toe,
              Stop; Heel, Toe, Stop; I repeat to myself, maintaining the rhythm
              of the music.
              <br /><br />
              My hands hurt. I begin to peel the glue off my skin as my mom
              presses down on the board, hoping the materials stick. I am
              working on my seventh-grade mosaic project, and I decided to
              create an Aztec Emperor penacho (headpiece).
              <br /><br />
              My cleaning cloth soaks. I analyze the buttons on our music system
              as my family cleans to the rhythm of cumbias. It is a Sunday at my
              house, and our cleaning music plays while we dust our furniture.
              <br /><br />
              The sun shines. My hands grip on the rope-like railing as I climb
              up the pyramid. I am in Teotihuacan, and I want to see the view
              from the peak of the sun pyramid.
              <br /><br />
              As a STEM enthusiast, I have always appreciated math and science,
              serving as universal languages. One plus one is two here and
              everywhere. We are all composed of similar particles that behave
              similarly. STEM celebrates our shared origins and history, but art
              celebrates our uniqueness.
              <br /><br />
              Through art, we express our heritage and culture. Dance, artwork,
              music, and architecture convey our diversity. I never felt more
              connected to my Mexican roots than when I performed folkloric
              dances at my school, presented my mosaic to my class, listened to
              cumbias, and touched the center of the sun pyramid.
              <br /><br />
              In Mexico, I observed how culturally and artistically rich the
              country is. From the beauty of Teotihuacan to the artesanías
              (crafts) sold on the streets, so many stories get told.
              <br /><br />
              Though I've never been too inclined towards the arts, I've learned
              to appreciate them for their contribution to society and culture.
              That inspired me to endeavor and continue exploring art history.
              Paintings and sculptures serve more than an aesthetic purpose;
              they are long-standing symbols of past lives and civilizations.
              <br /><br />
              I wish to continue traveling and analyzing how different people
              use the resources nature has granted us to capture the complexity
              of humankind. Art and STEM both share our history in different
              ways.
              <br /><br />
              Every swing of my folkloric skirt is a reminder of where I come
              from; the stars are reminders of where I will go.
