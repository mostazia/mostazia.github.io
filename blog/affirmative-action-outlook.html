              <span id="americanDream"></span>
              In the twenties, while some enjoyed their fortunes and lavish
              lifestyles, others discovered that the American Dream extended
              beyond financial success and entailed social and self-acceptance.
              Even the rich discovered the American Dream was unattainable.
              Their sentiment was further strengthened in the decade to come.
              <br /><br />In today's twenties, while some enjoy their legacy
              college acceptances and generational wealth, other students
              discover that people view their success as a handout in the name
              of 'diversity'. And, as a result, the American Dream remains
              unattainable. Our sentiment was further strengthened by the ruling
              of the Supreme Court a few days ago which favored institutional
              barriers and the social unacceptance of minority students in
              higher education. <br /><br />When I read the Great Gatsby in
              eleventh grade, I learned that not all money and success were seen
              as equal. I was introduced to the distinction between old money
              and new money. And, my perspective on the country I lived in
              changed. <br /><br />I grew up a strong believer of the American
              Dream. My immigrant parents have always been extremely grateful
              for the life they were able to build in this foreign country. So,
              they shared their American Dream with me: to see me and my sister
              as college graduates. As an American-born daughter of immigrant
              parents, I never doubted my ability to make their dreams come true
              because this country praised fairness and opportunity for all.
              <br /><br />
              <span id="immigrantStruggle"></span> However, as I grew older I
              began to see past the haze of promises and 'inspirational' words
              spoken by our leaders. The struggles and obstacles faced by
              immigrants and their children became clearer and clearer. We are
              not welcome here, and a significant number of fellow Americans
              only see us as trespassers and ‚Äújob stealers.‚Äù Many of our
              communities continue to live in impoverished conditions, our
              success limited by government policies and language barriers. In
              the words of Michelle Obama, ‚Äúthe ground is anything but level.‚Äù
              <br /><br />Those who do see us as the backbone of this country
              perceive our role as toilet-cleaners or fieldworkers. We are
              simply not considered capable of being part of the ‚Äúselect few‚Äù
              who excel. We are viewed as the lower class necessary for the
              success of other groups.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I completed
              eleventh grade believing that times were changing. The growth and
              celebration of self-made individuals served as proof.
              <br /><br />But, college admissions tell a different story.
              <br /><br />
              <span id="myStory"></span>
              I discovered the complex nature of college admissions too late. In
              ninth grade I learned that good grades and academic achievement
              did not suffice to compete. By tenth grade, I began pursuing more
              extracurricular activities, challenging coursework, and
              intellectual enrichment. I had two years to obtain commendable
              test scores, engage in impressive extracurricular activities, and
              discover the world mission and outlook I would provide on my
              college applications. By the end of eleventh grade, with my
              college admission fate practically sealed, all that was left was
              to condense my life and dreams into a compelling application.
              <br /><br />So, why did I put so much effort into getting into a
              Top 10 school? For the same reason any American, minority or not,
              would want to attend one: funding, research, and the opportunity
              to create change. <br /><br />Did I need the ‚Äúaffirmative action
              handout‚Äù? Absolutely. While some students were writing textbooks,
              I was saving up to afford them. While others were purchasing
              extensive private tutoring, I was browsing the internet for free
              practice SAT exams and applying for fee waivers. While others were
              starting nonprofits to help their communities, I tried to embody
              the change in my community by being the tutor others couldn't
              afford. I needed my college admissions officer to know that though
              my accomplishments were not as striking as some of my peers', they
              were still my pride and joy because I was able to organically
              flourish despite the adversity I faced as a minority student.
              <br /><br />I was simply too late, too poor, and too uninformed to
              compete under the same standards. My sister pursued a completely
              different path in regards to college education, so I lacked a
              mentor to guide me through the process. My parents had to save up
              to drive me to advanced math seminars, and the closest testing
              center for certain math competitions was 100 miles away. By the
              time I discovered the strategies and resources that were at my
              disposal, I was already a high school senior. <br /><br />
              <span id="affirmativeAction"></span>
              Many Black and Latine students come from communities where
              resources are scarce and conditions are unfavorable for them to
              achieve success as early as some White and Asian American
              students. As a result, they cannot compete against the same
              standards.
              <br /><br />Affirmative action is not intended to discriminate
              against White and Asian American students or make them pay the
              price for the struggles of Black and Latino communities. Rather,
              it is meant to be a bandaid on the bullet hole caused by the
              historical marginalization of these minorities. Our goal is to one
              day rip off the bandaid when the wound has healed. Our goal is to
              someday find affirmative action unnecessary. <br /><br />Like
              everything, affirmative action has its pros and cons. Although it
              is not entirely good, by today's conditions, it is necessary. I
              will not ignore the feelings of stress it may generate in White
              and Asian American students. I understand that it can be
              discouraging to feel that the bar is raised higher just because of
              your race. However, affirmative action is not to blame for this,
              but, rather, the meritocracy system surrounding college admissions
              and financial success, where spots are scarce and only a few can
              excel. Affirmative action or not, class sizes are sealed and some
              will be rejected, others accepted. <br /><br />But, I will also
              not ignore the impostor syndrome and discouragement of Black and
              Latino individuals when they are labeled ‚Äúspot stealers‚Äù or
              ‚Äúdiversity recruits.‚Äù Those who choose to diminish the efforts of
              students and professionals because they did not have a high degree
              of achievements at a young age hold similar sentiments to those
              that looked down upon new money and self-made individuals. It is
              hard to be born successful when your ancestors died feeling
              worthless. <br /><br />As college students, we are forced to live
              in a society in which the wedge between old money and new money
              remains strong. It is unfortunate that society has pitted
              first-generation college communities against one another when
              legacy admissions enjoy their own version of affirmative action.
              <br /><br />Maybe I needed the standards to be lowered. But,
              legacy students often find the standards to be non-existent. Only
              those students are capable of being born successful. And, while it
              is not their fault that they were born into those families, if
              society expects all students to compete on the same playing field
              regardless of what their ancestors faced, they should also earn
              their spot regardless of what their ancestors achieved.
              <br /><br />Many argue that affirmative action is a form of
              systemic racism. Perhaps that is true. But it seems that we need
              systemic ‚Äúracism‚Äù to combat the true systemic racism that minority
              students face. Since the SCOTUS found that it was necessary to
              defend the Constitution and ban this form of systemic racism, I
              hope that they also find it urgent to combat racism in healthcare
              and police brutality. <br /><br />We cannot preach equality when
              our communities need equity. <br /><br />
              <span id="finalThoughts"></span>
              I feel terribly sorry for the students that are barely making
              their way into higher education, and are finding out that they
              can't receive the handouts in exchange for what this country has
              taken away from them for centuries. Additionally, I feel for all
              the students who will no longer be able to speak on how their
              cultural, ethnic, and racial backgrounds have shaped their
              identities and the perspectives they will bring to their
              institution. To enforce ‚Äúcolorblind‚Äù college admissions is to
              ignore a crucial part of many students' identity. Our lives and
              experiences are not colorblind. And, the opportunities presented
              to us aren't colorblind either. <br /><br />If any student thinks
              that I stole their spot at MIT, I want them to know that (though
              it should not be necessary) I will do my absolute best to show the
              world that I deserve and have earned my spot at my institution and
              that, now more than ever, I will strive to become the leader and
              the mentor that my fellow latino students deserve and need. I may
              have found my voice a little later but that does not make it any
              quieter. <br /><br />To all other minority college students and
              professionals, let's become the representation we want to see in
              our communities. Let's create the equity that our government has
              denied us. <br /><br />Lastly, I hope that as minorities, we are
              once again able to mend this wedge that the elite few have drawn
              between us. I hope that we stop seeing each other as ‚Äúdream
              stealers" and, instead, begin seeing each other as collaborators
              and fellow warriors against racism and adversity. I hope that one
              day affirmative action can be a topic of the past and that the
              ground is leveled. <br /><br />I pray that one day there won't be
              any parallels between these twenties and the 1920's. As
              minorities, we can become our ancestors' American Dreams.
