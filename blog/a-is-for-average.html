              <span id="introduction"></span>
              Is calling someone 'smart' a compliment or a curse?
              <br /><br />
              I grew up as a high-achieving student, and I've asked myself the
              same question numerous times growing up. Even just scrolling
              through TikTok, I've come across many comment sections where
              people bond over being 'formerly gifted'. And, as a typical
              self-conscious teenager, I've wondered when the day where I will
              be able to consider myself 'formerly smart' would come.
              <br /><br />
              Now, when this fear mixes with the impostor syndrome that comes
              with attending a top college, mental poison is formed, and the
              search for an antidote begins.
              <br /><br />
              In fact, in this blog post, I have already shared an example of a
              dangerous mindset that I'm sure many didn't notice: typical
              self-conscious teenager. Now, I'm sure there is extensive
              literature that discusses the effects of labeling teenagers and
              young adults as self-conscious. After all, 'self-conscious' is a
              negative adjective and that is sufficiently evident. However, I
              think the word 'typical' is more dangerous. It goes unnoticed as
              negative and, thus, kills in silence.
              <br /><br />
              I'm flying back to college tomorrow to start a new semester of
              college, yet I haven't gotten myself to finish my 'Freshman Year
              in Review' blog post, and I undeniably feel guilty writing a
              different post before finishing it. However, after a bit of
              introspection, it's become increasingly clear that I'm dreading
              finishing the post because there is just too much to unpack from
              my freshman year of college. The year felt like a sine wave or a
              roller coaster, and I am not exactly ecstatic to take myself back
              to that unstable mindset. Additionally, I'm not sure how the post
              will be received, or if I want people to see the side of me that
              isn't breezing through school. In short, me struggling is not
              something my audience would perceive as 'expected' or 'normal'.
              <br /><br />
              So, in this post, I will try to unpack one of my biggest obstacles
              freshman year: impostor syndrome and blending in. While I'm sure I
              will only scrape at the surface of this complex mental challenge,
              I hope this post will resonate with other victims of the word
              'typical'.
              <br /><br />
              <span id="normal"></span>
              So, why is the word 'normal' even dangerous? Let me walk you
              through a mindset and thought process I've had my whole life.
              <br /><br />
              <i
                >How can I thrive? Well, for starters, I want to be socially
                accepted but also successful. And, the truth is, successful
                people can't be average people. But, I also don't want to be
                lonely. So, let's see. I need to fit in but not blend in. I
                shouldn't want to be like the other kids, but I also can't be
                too eccentric. I need to be a normal person, but also not basic.
                And, above all, I need to stand out but not feel like an
                impostor.
              </i>
              <br /><br />
              Now, this might sound a lot like the Barbie movie monologue.
              Surprisingly, I realized that after reading it; it was not
              intentional. It just showcases a similar thought pattern that many
              women and young individuals struggle with: the fear of the
              extremes. No one wants to be too much of one thing. Everyone needs
              to be 'just right'. <i>But isn't just right, just basic?</i>
              <br /><br />
              The spiral never stops. So, here's the deal: what does normal even
              mean?
              <br /><br />
              Now, I'm sure many will begin to list qualities that a 'normal
              person' has. But, I want to break down the word 'normal' itself.
              <br /><br />
              Normal, typical, average, the middle 60% of the normal bell curve.
              These are all basically synonyms. Awe yes, basic, the word that
              makes 'normal' an insult. So, bringing up the normal curve has
              actually given me an idea,‚Äîsince talking about feelings and words
              is becoming a little too subjective from my STEMy self, why don't
              we take a statistical approach at defining 'normal'?
              <br /><br />
              Okay, well, the average in Statistics can be either the mean or
              median or another statistic that measures, well, 'average'. But,
              in order to find these statistics, we need to have data. And, to
              have data, we need to have a sample.
              <br /><br />
              Good news and bad news. Unfortunately, we have found our first
              issue: we need to consider other people. Fortunately, we have
              found our first piece of evidence that normal is an illusion.
              <br /><br />
              <span id="sample"></span>
              Many kids grow up in one place and never get to experience living
              elsewhere. I was one of those kids: the only times I've switched
              schools are when I got promoted from sixth grade to middle school
              and when I got promoted from high school to college. I also grew
              up in a town that was pretty far from other communities. So, for
              eighteen years, I was in a little bubble.
              <br /><br />
              Thus, my sample was pretty consistent, until it wasn't.
              <br /><br />
              For eighteen years, my sample considered me smart since I picked
              up difficult concepts faster than a lot of my peers. So, I was
              encouraged to find an institution of higher education that could
              'exploit' (for lack of a better word) and unleash my potential.
              <br /><br />
              So, I took myself to Cambridge, MA, fully ready to change the
              world. However, I don't think my seventeen-year-old, inspired
              brain was comprehending what a drastic change I was going to
              experience.
              <br /><br />
              For starters, my sample changed‚Ä¶ significantly.
              <br /><br />
              I was introduced to a community full of kids that had perfect
              grades and a long track record of AP courses from high school. So,
              that wasn't enough to make me stand out. It was now time to find
              identity outside of my grades.
              <br /><br />
              Straight As were now average. Lovely.
              <br /><br />
              So, here is my second issue: I was too busy trying to be one of
              the top 1% in high school that I never discovered what my identity
              outside of school was. Now, I was in this weird position where I
              was very excited to be surrounded by people who were as passionate
              about tech as I was and particularly excited for people to not
              treat me differently because I was good at academics. And, this
              felt good for a little. But then, I needed to start standing out
              and being special out of fear of being basic (and, also, fear of
              being unemployed SOV).
              <br /><br />
              So, when classes started, and it wasn't a breeze like high school,
              it felt like a 'be careful what you wish for' moment; I felt like
              I was standing out, as an impostor. Great. So, now, I'm no longer
              basic :smile:. Now, I'm just bad :sad:.
              <br /><br />
              At best, I was relatively average. At MIT.
              <br /><br />
              So, when I came back home for Christmas break, I was very excited
              because I was going to see NORMAL people and do NORMAL things.
              Basically, I was trying to switch my sample back to what it used
              to be since this sample made me feel better about myself.
              <br /><br />
              <span id="denormalizing"></span>
              Life is a huge comparison trap and the concept of 'normal' is one
              of the biggest perpetrators.
              <br /><br />
              In high school, when top students did poorly on exams, it made
              others feel better about their low scores because they were
              relatively decent. Now, I've glossed over this idea in my blog
              post ‚ÄúI am a Mansplainer‚Äù: as humans, we desire to categorize,
              label, and predict. Thus, we are pushed to create standards for
              comparison: normals.
              <br /><br />
              And, it's so unhealthy to base our self-worth on 'where we stand'
              among a group of people. It makes us prone to mental and emotional
              instability when we switch environments.
              <br /><br />
              Further, we don't just experience the dangers of normal in
              academic environments; trends and regional political beliefs also
              prove that the concept of 'normal' has such a chokehold on
              society. They prove that 'normal' doesn't exist. Trends are always
              changing and what is normal in one era is cringe-worthy in
              another. What is smart in one school, is average in another. When
              I vented and expressed my fears and thoughts to my high school
              best friend (and potentially one of the wisest young people I
              know), she gave me a piece of advice that was able to heal and
              undo a school year's worth of stress and anxiety. She said, ‚Äúdon't
              forget that your intelligence is self-contained and you are just
              as smart at MIT as you were in high school‚Äù. In short, I wasn't
              any more or less smart depending on who was around me. And I
              shouldn't let my 'sample' affect my identity and self-love.
              <br /><br />
              There is simply no universal normal. And, if we spend so much time
              worrying about not being completely normal, then no one will be
              'normal'. And, that kind of defeats the whole purpose of the word.
              <br /><br />
              <span id="conclusion"></span>
              Now, I'm sure this blog post won't magically cure people's
              impostor syndrome. Like I said, it is poison, and no one really
              knows the antidote. Probably because how we overcome impostor
              syndrome and insecurity is something so (ironically) relative and
              personal to each person.
              <br /><br />
              But, my hopes are that this blog post is a step forward in
              normalizing (:skull:) conversations surrounding impostor syndrome
              and overcoming patterns of academic self-worth. Additionally, I
              want to break the concept of 'normal' that I have created for
              myself. And, I certainly don't want to feel guilty for ruining the
              illusion of 'Stacy the perfect student' others may have. College
              is a huge learning experience and 'normal' doesn't exist.
              <br /><br />
              So, is calling someone smart a compliment or a curse?
              <br /><br />
              Well it's both. In fact, not many things are mutually exclusive.
              You can be brave and still experience fear. You can be happy and
              still have bad days. You can be intelligent and still struggle.
              <br /><br />
              Frankly, I don't have an answer for that question yet. But, I will
              continue to search for it. After all, I'm only 25% done with
              college. I'm certain there is so much left for me to learn and so
              many conversations and thoughts for me to share in this space. So,
              I hope you follow along and witness my growth and the dozens of
              more informal blog posts I have to share (who said I stopped being
              a kid :smile:).
              <br /><br />
              So, tl;dr, A is not for average, A is for whatever an A means to
              you. Because in the end, it's your grade and that's all that
              matters!
