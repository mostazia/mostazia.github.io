              There are two things that would make fourteen year old Stacy feel
              like she has unlimited power: <br />`<br />1. Pull an uno reverse
              card on College Board and grade them.<br /><br />2. Embrace my
              Abby Lee Miller arc and make my very own Dance Moms pyramid
              <br /><br />Now that I'm in college, one of my greatest goals is
              to not have peaked in high school. And, this post is giving 1 step
              forward + 3 steps back, but I think my commentary could be useful
              to the high schoolers out there struggling to select classes.
              Plus, this post is a great inauguration to the series of tier
              lists that I will be posting throughout college; course
              evaluations will never be enough for me. <br /><br />I know that
              every class has a unique purpose and the format of the course and
              exam is designed to best assess the skills relevant to it. But,
              for the sake of simplicity and objectivity, I will evaluate these
              classes using a six-point rubric that I believe encompasses their
              complexity into a score on 1-5 scale ;) <br /><br />
              <span id="rubric"></span>
              After a lot of thought and consideration, here is the rubric I
              came up with:
              <br /><br />
              <table>
                <tr>

                    0: Lowkey showed up to the test with 0 clue on how to
                    optimize my score, and just prayed for the best (yes I
                    googled the course and exam description)

              <span id="pyramid"></span>
              Now that I have established my grading criteria, I will share my
              ultimate AP pyramid; drum roll please‚Ä¶
              <img src="../Images/14APClassesLaterPyramid.png" width="100%" />
              <br /><br />So, here's my commentary for each class:<br /><br />
              <span id="commentary"></span>
              <span class="highlightText">AP Spanish Literature</span>: 1 / 1 /
              2 / 1 / 1<br />For most people, this class was a hit or miss. For
              me, it was a complete hit. I knew what was expected of me and the
              class was structured incredibly well. Despite its focus on
              literature and analysis, I learned so much about history and
              literary and artistic movements; a lot of my knowledge crossed
              over to other classes. The works we studied were actually amazing,
              some of my favorite pieces of literature come from this class. My
              teacher loved reading literature, so he provided us with great
              insight into the literature. I felt that this class helped me
              discover and connect with literature in my mother tongue.
              <br /><br /><span class="highlightText">AP Biology</span>: 1 / 1 /
              2 / 1 / 0<br />Biology is by far the best structured AP class. The
              course and exam description itself was enough to study and revise
              the content for the exam. I went into it feeling very prepared,
              and I knew what I was expected to learn. The class was also very
              interesting; I even considered pursuing a bio major because of it.
              Last but not least, my teacher was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. She was so
              knowledgeable and passionate about the field, knew how to break
              down concepts, and was the right amount of rigorous. Quite
              frankly, this class made me a better student. <br /><br /><span
                class="highlightText"
                >AP Calculus BC</span
              >: 1 / 1 / 2 / 1 / 0<br />Calc BC was one of the classes that I
              felt very confident in. I came out of the class feeling very
              comfortable in calculus. Series and parametrics changed my way of
              thinking about math, which has helped me conceptualize more
              difficult topics in college. My teacher was fabulous, so I was
              able to get a lot of practice before the exam, even though it was
              COVID year. It didn't change my perception of the world, but it
              got the job done. <br /><br /><span class="highlightText"
                >AP Art History</span
              >: 1 / 0 / 1 / 1 / 1<br />Art History is one of those classes that
              rely heavily on memorization, so you knew what you had to do but
              you weren't invested in the class. As a result, the content was
              super relevant to the exam, but the structure of review,
              memorization, and go was kind of a flop. My teacher was wonderful
              though and did the best she could to keep us engaged. I do,
              however, feel like I came out of the class understanding history
              and culture a lot more deeply; it gave me a completely new
              skillset. <br /><br /><span class="highlightText"
                >AP Macroeconomics</span
              >: 1 / 1 / 2 / 0 / 0<br />AP Macro was actually a pretty fun
              class. I learned something completely new and got to use some of
              my logic skills. I felt prepared for the exam throughout the class
              and everything we learned gave me a solid introduction to
              economics. My teacher was very intelligent, but he wasn't the best
              at explaining things. So, since this was a completely new subject,
              I had to do a significant amount of self teaching. The class
              simplified a lot of econ, so almost everything I learned was not
              really applicable outside of class. <br /><br /><span
                class="highlightText"
                >AP Calculus AB</span
              >: 1 / 0 / 2 / 1 / 0<br />I took this class as a prerequisite for
              Calc BC, so I felt like I got a solid foundation for calculus. I
              knew how to perform well on the exam, and everything we learned
              was relevant. I had the same teacher for both classes, so,
              naturally, the teaching was great. I just found this class a
              little less interesting since I hadn't really learned any
              applications of calculus yet. <br /><br /><span
                class="highlightText"
                >AP Psychology</span
              >: 0 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 0 <br />Quite frankly, on exam day, I had very
              little clue what I was doing. I went through the class and learned
              the material, but I never really understood how it would be
              assessed. It seemed like they would throw random vocab words at
              you and ask you to explain them in context, which is hard to
              prepare for. A lot of the content was interesting though;
              explaining human behavior encourages a lot of reflection and
              thought. This class was mostly memorization, so the content was
              relevant. I just wish they relied less on definitions and more on
              encouraging thinking and hypothesizing. <br /><br /><span
                class="highlightText"
                >AP United States History</span
              >: 0 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 0<br />It's the way that the second DBQ I wrote
              in my life was the exam DBQ. APUSH is one of the hardest AP
              classes, and I felt it was really hard to prepare for it. I felt
              like I had to change my thinking to ‚Äúwhat would College Board
              think‚Äù and develop a lot of exam strategies. This resulted in the
              class feeling like an SAT part 2. The class did give me a lot of
              new insight on US History. It is way too packed, though; we did
              not finish the course content by exam day. My teacher was pretty
              good, and she made the class as engaging as it could be.
              <br /><br /><span class="highlightText">AP Physics I</span>: 0 / 0
              / 2 / 1 / 0<br />This class was so SKULL. I did a lot of exam
              practice using past exams, but when I would use AP Classroom, a
              lot of the questions were in a completely different style. The
              exam ended up mirroring AP Classroom SOB. They also got rid of two
              units about a month before the exam and made most of the exam on
              collisions. So, if you didn't master collisions, it was incredibly
              difficult. Overall, I just felt unprepared for the test. AP
              Physics I is a lot of memorization, so the content was relevant to
              the course but not to real life. I wish I had learned
              calculus-based physics instead. It was helpful when it came to
              conceptualizing physics in college, but I felt as experienced as
              someone that was brand new to physics. <br /><br /><span
                class="highlightText"
                >AP Spanish Language and Culture</span
              >: 1 / 0 / 1 / 1 / 0<br />I went into the AP Spanish exam feeling
              like I had a template in my head for every response. So, I felt
              prepared. However, the rest of the class felt super random. A lot
              of the content we learned about social media, beauty standards,
              and environmentalism never appeared on the exam, though it was
              well structured. My teacher was a good amount of rigorous; she
              gave us feedback such that we could improve and target a good
              score on the exam. <br /><br /><span class="highlightText"
                >AP Statistics</span
              >: 1 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0<br />I will always say that AP stats was a
              bunch of fake math; a lot of the formulas and concepts we learned
              felt arbitrary, and I did significantly more writing than math.
              Stats highkey felt like the humanities of math. I knew what I had
              to know, but I could not make myself interested in it. I did
              appreciate the structure of the class though; by the end of it, I
              was able to connect all the concepts and answer FRQs. I hate
              giving this class a 0 in teaching because my teacher is one of the
              kindest people, but I feel like no one can teach this class. It's
              far too boring and oversimplified to be able to properly teach it.

                >AP United States Government</span
              >: 0 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0<br />This class was by far the more relevant
              AP class I took. However, it was a weird combination of
              vocabulary-based and argument-based, such that I had a mega
              quizlet but also needed to know how to write. The content we
              learned was relevant but a lot of it was repetitive so the course
              structure was a little unclear. However, since a lot of what was
              discussed was relevant, the class was near intuitive.

                >AP English Literature</span
              >: 0 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0 <br />Ranking English classes last is giving
              major STEM energy, but, objectively, these classes felt so random.
              I went into the exam not really knowing what to do. All of the AP
              Dailys just echoed the course rubric, so it was quite difficult to
              prepare for the exam; you didn't know what to expect. The stories
              we read and essays I wrote in class did give me a little
              preparation, so I would say the content was as relevant as it
              could've been. Needless to say, my teacher tried her best, and I
              appreciate her, but this course is far too unpredictable for her
              to have done better. <br /><br /><span class="highlightText"
                >AP English Language</span
              >: 0 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0<br />Last and least, AP English Language anI
              have 0 memories of this class. We finished the course content in
              one semester and then read Gatsby for the rest of the year. This
              class was the ultimate unpredictable AP course. It felt like we
              just learned some key buzz words and hoped for the best. My
              teacher did try her best to help us digest the rubric and learn
              the required skills. It was just very difficult to apply without
              extra practice. <br /><br />
              <span id="conclusion"></span>
              Soooo, thank you for coming to my venting session. Though I didn't
              get much credit for the AP classes I took in high school, I still
              don't truly regret taking any of them. I felt like they each
              taught me something new, whether it was ‚Äúhow to market a bad
              essay‚Äù or ‚Äúpractice makes permanent.‚Äù I learned how to adapt,
              memorize, and survive.
