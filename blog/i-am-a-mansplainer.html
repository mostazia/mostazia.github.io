              The world has always valued prediction. Both psychics and
              financial analysts live on prediction. Their job is to foresee the
              future, so that we can maximize success and minimize misfortune.
              As a consequence, humans have developed reliable
              pattern-identification skills. <br /><br />
              Everyone knows the classic IQ test question: given a sequence of
              numbers or illustrations, identify the missing / following item.
              Nowadays, we train AI to help us predict. As I write this blog
              post, my handy document editor offers to finish my phrases and
              sentences. And, I would be lying if I said I didn't find Google
              autocomplete satisfying. Given sufficient data, we can figure out
              what to expect.
              <br /><br />
              I began tutoring when I was nine and have continued since. Helping
              multiple classmates with long division, I identified common
              misconceptions and prepared answers to address them; years later,
              I still use this approach. So, naturally, I evolved into a
              mansplainer.
              <br /><br />
              <span class="highlightText">Mansplainer</span>&nbsp;[noun,
              informal; /m√¶nsple…™n…ö/]: a man that explains (usually to a woman)
              in a patronizing manner. <br /><br />
              Or, what my friends call it ‚Äî to spare my feelings ‚Äî a tutor. Now,
              before I get canceled, my claim is not that tutors are
              mansplainers (we love tutors; tutors are very snazzy), but,
              rather, that my desire for the convenience of predicting sometimes
              comes at the expense of my students' confidence and understanding.
              <br /><br />Consider the following scenario: a student asks me to
              confirm if the surface area of a square is given by 4œÄr2, and I
              tell her, ‚Äúyes because surface area is the derivative of the
              volume which is 4/3œÄr3.‚Äù<br /><br />Now, for some students
              providing that explanation might give them insight they hadn't
              considered before, allowing them to understand the concept rather
              than rely on a formula. But, some students want to think for
              themselves. See, when you think about the origin of a math formula
              you don't just gain an understanding of why the formula holds but
              also thinking skills that are applicable to more challenging
              questions. When someone gives you the explanation, you are
              guaranteed to obtain the former but not the latter. You might
              learn from the way the tutor thought about the problem and choose
              to adopt it. But, you lack the reward mechanism, the satisfaction
              of arriving at a solution. <br /><br />Consider the following
              scenario: a student asks if a negative number multiplied by a
              negative number gives a positive, and I reply, ‚Äúyes, and a
              negative times a positive gives a negative.‚Äù<br /><br />
              <span id="informationIsHarmless" class="blogPostContentH2"
                >Claim: a little extra information doesn't hurt anyone‚Ä¶</span
              >
              <br /><br />Wrong :( ! At MIT, I discovered that a little extra
              information isn't as harmless as it seems. When I seek tutoring, I
              seek a dynamic similar to that of speaking to a colleague; I don't
              seek to feel inferior to my tutor (perhaps stemming a little bit
              from my academic ego). So, giving that extra information could
              make a student feel like the tutor expects they know less than
              they do. A lot of success in academics comes from confidence.
              <br /><br />This is where mansplaining comes in. There are times
              when we want to spare a student some questions, so from our
              experience, we answer them ahead of time, like the situations
              above. Additionally, there are times when we feel a student could
              benefit from thinking about a concept in a certain way because it
              was helpful for us. So, we provide that information. For example,
              when a student is learning the unit circle, it's tempting to
              encourage them to see its foundation in trigonometry ahead of
              time. All of our brains are wired differently, so projecting our
              rationale is not always ideal. <br /><br />
              <span id="independentThinkers" class="blogPostContentH2"
                >Claim: motivating independent thinking can be fruitful‚Ä¶</span
              >
              <br /><br />Maybe! For this claim, I don't have a binary response.
              This raises a question about teaching that many educators and
              professionals are working to address. How much information should
              teachers provide? Are vague, open-ended answers more helpful than
              direct ones? Would this cause more confusion or frustration? Some
              students need more hints than others. Some students want more
              hints than others. This is why I respect teachers immensely. They
              have to find a strategy that works for a class made up of students
              with different learning styles, and adapt that strategy as
              generations change. <br /><br />After COVID, I noticed that a lot
              of our attention span, as a generation, decreased (I wouldn't be
              surprised if half of my readers have clicked away by now). We
              began to gravitate towards Tiktok's fifteen second videos over
              Youtube's longer videos. And, like many others, I appreciate those
              moments when I google a question and a short answer appears at the
              top of the search results in a large font and bolded letters.
              <br /><br />We have grown up with so much information at our
              fingertips, that it has become overwhelming. I find that I can
              only digest so much information at a time. I've even noticed that,
              when asking for help, I sometimes ask for a pause in which I can
              process and fully understand the last statement made.
              <br /><br />So, turns out, a little extra information can be
              negative. (Not to mention, those last minute clarification
              questions when a student might ask about negative number
              multiplication, and after giving that extra bit of information, a
              student can't properly recall what you said because their brain
              couldn't register that much in that small timeframe.)<br /><br />
              <span id="whyMansplaining" class="blogPostContentH2">
                Question: why call it mansplaining instead of overexplaining?
              </span>
              <br /><br />Well, a lot of mansplaining roots from misogyny and
              prejudice. And, this faulty approach to teaching also stems from
              prejudice, assuming that a person asking for help inherently knows
              and understands less. <br /><br />I have observed this trend in
              fellow MIT classmates, as well. Back home, many of us were the
              go-to 'tutors'. We answered questions for classmates who were
              struggling to understand. And, in high school, comprehension is
              more binary than it is in college. You either know your formulas,
              or you don't. At MIT, however, that line is very blurred; a
              student can be one clarification away from mastering a topic. And,
              at a place like MIT, maintaining confidence in the face of
              impostor syndrome is key, especially since many students are
              learning to ask for help for the first time. <br /><br />
              <span id="theFuture"></span>
              As I conclude this post, I can't help but recall my reaction to
              when I was called a mansplainer. As a seventeen year old girl who
              adored teaching and helping others, 'mansplainer' was the last
              title I would've expected. But, I've come far since then. Instead
              of feeling hurt, I acknowledge that my teaching style is not
              foolproof, and I'm excited to learn more about education.
              <br /><br />I've always seen pattern-matching as a way to improve.
              Yet, I now realize that a lot of prejudice roots from people's
              'reliable' yet still imperfect 'pattern-matching.' Just as we
              strive to predict, it is also our job to look back and strive to
              fix our flaws. <br /><br />I have made a lot of claims in this
              post. And I would like to warn that a lot of my thoughts are
              merely a product of observation. I don't have a degree in
              education, simply experience. So, everything I said in this post
              could hold some truth. Or, it could be another example in which
              human prediction fails. <br /><br />Regardless, I can confidently
              say that this post is another opportunity to learn.
