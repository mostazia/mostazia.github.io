              Halloween 2023: Do you guys ever think about DIYing?
            </div>
            <div class="blogPostContent">
              <span id="introduction"></span>
              I am a child of DIY. Part of the reason I am a STEMie is because I
              am not my mom. My mom is the most artistic person I know; if you
              ask her to make any craft, she will find a way to do it and make
              it beautiful, even if she's never done something similar before. I
              mean, she basically carried my K-6 school projects. And, I would
              like to think that, as her daughter, I inherited 50% of her
              crafting ability. <br /><br />
              12 years ago, I was a second-grader learning how to write
              paragraphs. I vividly remember one of our prompts: what did you do
              over the long three-day (indigenous people's day) weekend. I
              proudly (and choppily) wrote down the story of my mom making my
              Halloween costume from scratch. That year, I was going to be a
              witch. Since I can remember, my mom has created my Halloween
              costume: a scarecrow in kindergarten, witch in second grade, and a
              mummy in fifth. We would take a road trip to LA to buy fabric, and
              she would sit at the sewing machine for a whole weekend to put it
              together. I felt incredibly special and loved.
              <br /><br />
              However, my crafting ability is‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ questionable. I've always
              been the person to overcomplicate simple artistic tasks rather
              than invent clever shortcuts. Perhaps my brain was wired to
              conceptualize complex ideas and not to exploit a shortcut or
              loophole. So, while the field of arts and crafts doesn't come
              naturally to me, I still picked up some things over the years of
              watching my mom make masterpiece after masterpiece. And, by 2017,
              I was consuming significant DIY Youtuber content (shout out to
              LaurDIY and Sarabeautycorner) to compensate.
              <br /><br />
              I quit celebrating Halloween after 2016 (felt too old üòî). But, I
              decided to make a comeback this year for Barbie (years of playing
              with Barbies have led me to this moment). And, when I found that
              my costume was way too long for my short legs, I realized it was
              time to unlock and relive part of my childhood and bring out the
              sewing kit.
              <br /><br />
              So, here's a blog post on how I made my Halloween costume suitable
              for my 5'1 (155 cm) self. I wouldn't call this a tutorial since I
              was kind of experimenting and being risky; I would describe it as
              a summary of a journey.
              <br /><br />
              <span id="plan"></span>
              When I tried on my costume in my dorm, I realized it was VERY
              long. So, I had two options: buy a pair of platform heels to
              compensate for my shortness. Or, cut it. As a somewhat poor
              college student, I decided scissors was the way to go. I didn't
              have a plan for how much I wanted to cut; the pants were bell
              bottoms, so it was hard to tell how much longer than my heels they
              were.
              <br /><br />
              So, I decided to play it safe and start by cutting an inch.
              <br /><br />
              I gathered my supplies:
              <br />
              <span style="color: #06617a">

                kit: fabric scissors, light pink and red thread, a needle, and

              >
              <br /><br />
              <span id="cutting"></span>
              I used my ruler to mark several one inch marks along the bottom of
              each leg.
              <br /><br />
              <span style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center">
                <span
                  style="
                    width: 100%;
                    height: 40vh;
                    background-size: contain;
                    background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    background-position: center;
                    background-image: url('../Images/BPImages/H2023RulerDash.jpg');
                  "
                ></span>
              </span>
              <br />
              Then, I went with my chalk and connected the line (eyeballing
              moment).
              <br /><br />
              <span style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center">
                <span
                  style="
                    width: 100%;
                    height: 40vh;
                    background-size: contain;
                    background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    background-position: center;
                    background-image: url('../Images/BPImages/H2023ChalkDash.jpg');
                  "
                ></span>
              </span>
              <br />
              Then, I grabbed my fabric scissors and cut along the solid line.
              I, then, realized that one inch was nowhere near the length I
              needed to get rid of. So, I decided to cut an extra four inches.
              After getting comfortable with the fabric and the scissors, I
              decided to cut four inches in one go. I repeated the same process
              as before and used the sewing pins to hold the pant leg in place
              while I cut.
              <br /><br />
              <span style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center">
                <span
                  style="
                    width: 100%;
                    height: 40vh;
                    background-size: contain;
                    background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    background-position: center;
                    background-image: url('../Images/BPImages/H2023Pin.jpg');
                  "
                ></span>
              </span>
              <br />
              I wanted to add a ¬Ω inch hem, so I used my chalk and ruler again
              and marked one inch above the bottom.
              <br /><br />
              <span style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center">
                <span
                  style="
                    width: 100%;
                    height: 40vh;
                    background-size: contain;
                    background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    background-position: center;
                    background-image: url('../Images/BPImages/H2023HemDash.jpg');
                  "
                ></span>
                <span
                  style="
                    width: 100%;
                    height: 40vh;
                    background-size: contain;
                    background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    background-position: center;
                    background-image: url('../Images/BPImages/H2023HemSew.jpg');
                  "
                ></span>
              </span>
              <br />
              And, I went in and handsewed the hem using my light pink thread!
              I, now, had a significant difference in leg length!
              <br /><br />
              <span style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center">
                <span
                  style="
                    width: 100%;
                    height: 40vh;
                    background-size: contain;
                    background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    background-position: center;
                    background-image: url('../Images/BPImages/H2023Comparison.jpg');
                  "
                ></span>
              </span>
              <br />
              I repeated this process on the other leg.
              <br /><br />
              <span id="ruffles"></span>
              I had A LOT of leftover fabric, and I was feeling very crafty.
              Suddenly, I channeled my inner 70s girl and thought of adding
              ruffles to the bells to make them more ‚ú®. I cut five strips of
              fabric per pant leg (each one inch in height). Then, I used a
              straight stitch to make the wave-like ruffles.
              <br /><br />
              <span style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center">
                <span
                  style="
                    transform: rotate(-90deg);
                    width: 100%;
                    height: 40vh;
                    background-size: contain;
                    background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    background-position: center;
                    background-image: url('../Images/BPImages/H2023RuffleSingle.jpg');
                  "
                ></span>
              </span>
              <br />
              I pinned the ruffles to the area of the leg I wanted to sew it
              into. Then, I went in with my needle and thread and sewed it in by
              attaching the ruffle to the fabric in the valleys of the ruffle. I
              added one ruffle at the hem and four along the bell. I used chalk
              to mark where I was going to sew them, to make sure they were
              leveled. This part took a lot of patience since it was quite
              repetitive, but I am in love with the finished product!
              <br /><br />

              While I didn't make my entire Barbie costume from scratch, I am
              very proud of myself for making lemonade out of lemons! Further,
              this was a craft that was feasible in my freetime (I am a
              full-time college student). Although I missed having my mom with
              me to help me, I am just happy that I am carrying along the DIY
              Halloween tradition.
